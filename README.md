# Sentiment Analysis with BERT - Yelp Reviews

## Description
This project applies the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews. It focuses on classifying reviews into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments, utilizing a fine-tuned BERT model.

## Features
- **BERT-Based Sentiment Classification**: Utilizes BERT for sentiment analysis.
- **Tri-Class Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies reviews into negative, neutral, and positive.
- **Data Preprocessing and Tokenization**: Includes text cleaning and sentiment labeling.
- **Model Customization**: Adapts BERT for Yelp review sentiment classification.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizes text and converts ratings to sentiment labels.
- **Model Architecture**: Fine-tunes BERT with additional layers for classification.
- **Training Strategy**: Uses learning rate scheduling and optimization techniques.

## Results
- High accuracy on validation and test datasets, demonstrating robustness and generalization.
- Detailed results include accuracy, loss metrics, and visualizations of the training process.
